I am currently 3rd year student at UP FAMNIT. I'm in the process of exploring a wide range of projects to discover my true interests.

Current Interests: Game Development, Web Development.

I love the idea of beginning with a fresh canvas and bringing my creative ideas to life. In web and game development, I get to build something meaningful from scratch, and that's what truly excites me.

Skills: Java / REACT / JS / Unity

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on completing my Bachelor's Degree. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Structures and various Algorithms in JS. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Through any of my social media accounts. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy participating in sports but don't have a strong interest in watching them.
